## Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars <br><br>


### In this homework we scraped information from different sources in order to give a resume of data from Mars, this sources are:

* Nasa Mars News - https://mars.nasa.gov/news/
* JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image - https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars
* Mars Weather - https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en
* Mars Facts - https://space-facts.com/mars/
* Mars Hemispheres - https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars <br><br>


### After the scraping we did a Flask web application to present the all the information together and even we used Bootstrap to give better looks. <br><br>
